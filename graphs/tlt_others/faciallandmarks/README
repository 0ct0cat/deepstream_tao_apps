This sample builds on top of the "deepstream-test1" graph to demonstrate how to
use NvDsFacialLandmarks related extensions.

The graph contains additional "NvDsFacialLandmarks" extension which include
(PreProcess/PostProcess), it will generate a NvDsFacePointsMetaData
user meta and attached it to face object.

================================================================================
Pre-requisites
================================================================================
- DeepStreamSDK 6.0 (https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk-6.0-early-access)
- Graph-Composer 0.5.0 (https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk-6.0-early-access)
- Sync extensions from NGC public repo if not already done:
    $ registry repo sync -n ngc-public

Running the graph
================================================================================
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.0/lib/cvcore_libs/
$ chmod 775 /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.0/samples/models/tlt_pretrained_models/faciallandmarks
$ chmod 775 /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.0/samples/models/tlt_pretrained_models/facenet
$ /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/execute_graph.sh App-FacialLandmarks.yaml App-FacialLandmarks.parameters.yaml

NOTE: App-FacialLandmarks.yaml is the main graph file describing the DeepStream
graph(pipeline) along with the configuration parameters for the components in the
graph. App-FacialLandmarks.parameters.yaml can be used to override these parameter values.
